# Scientific Machine Learning Workshop

This repository will contain all presentation slides, lab handouts, and lab code for the Scientific Machine Learning workshop at Cenpes. 

The workshop offers an opportunity for attendees to improve their analytical and computational skills in the rapidly-developing field of scientific machine learning and data-driven model order reduction, while preparing them to work in highly interdisciplinary research and development projects. The workshop is structured as follows:

## Day 1 (Braga Neto)
### Morning: 
- Introduction and overview
- Deep Neural Networks
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)
  
### Afternoon:
- Lab 1: PINN solution of forward and inverse problems

## Day 2 (Braga Neto)
### Morning:
- Neural Operators
- Uncertainty Quantification
- Gaussian Process regression
- Probabilistic PDE solvers

### Afternoon:
- Lab 2: Probabilistic solution of forward and inverse problems

## Day 3 (Gildin)  
### Morning:
- Introduction to Model Order Reduction 
- Physics-based MOR: Linear and Nonlinear Model Reduction
- Data-driven MOR Part 1: System Identification, SINDy, DMD 

### Afternoon:
- Lab 4a: Tutorial on Balanced Truncation, Krylov Subspaces, POD, POD-DEIM
- Lab 4b: POD-DEIM for reservoir simulation

## Day 4 (Gildin)
### Morning:
- Data-driven MOR Part 2: DMDc, OpInf, E2C0, FNO

### Afternoon:
- Lab 5: Implementation of basic data-driven MOR for reservoir simulation
